The main function is in main.c. It runs a Fourier transform analsyis on data kept in the file "puddlejump.txt", and reports the highest amplitude frequency in "result.txt".
"puddlejump.txt" should be a text file containing non-negative integers, delimited by whitespace and/or new lines.

Rather than requiring the user change the stack size, we used dynamic memory allocation (malloc) to allocate the large arrays needed for analysis.

To validate our program, we checked that it compiled, and compared the output to classmates to verify that we had the same frequency result. We also checked that the Gradescope autograder passed.
